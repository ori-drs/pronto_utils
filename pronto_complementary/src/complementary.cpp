// Very Basic Complementary Filter
// Tested to be very similar to quaterion output from Microstrain GX3-25 (in hand)
// as well as HyQ's KVH sensor
//
// 1. Assumes that input sensor mesurements have been transformed into:
//    x forward +, y left +, z up +
//
// 2. Can only work when incoming measurements are in first quadrant
//    i.e. as described above
//
// TODO: Support 4-quadrant support by detecting the current quadrant and switching
